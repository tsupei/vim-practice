# vim-practice
Vim is known as a very useful tool, I use this repository to record instructions for those who are beginners like me

# Directory Structure

`.vimrc` is the setting I used for vim. You can customize it! Just for something for template 

`Ultisnips` includes examples of my snippets settings.

# Requirement

## Mac OS

1. vim - I recommend to install vim through brew in order to include all useful features

```
	brew install vim	
```

2. vim-plugin - I use this vim plugin managers. Check [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjl-oe1oaXlAhVPGaYKHRnQB7AQFjADegQIAhAJ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjunegunn%2Fvim-plug&usg=AOvVaw32SuSCCpUjlJDguHYioMys) to learn more

# Small Projects

I believe practice is much more important than theory(or syntax). So I prepare some small projects for us to learn quickly

1. Laern basic vim commands
2. Define useful commands in `.vimrc`
3. Define snippets for markdown
